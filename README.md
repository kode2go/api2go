Http Request Methods â€“

GET	GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI.

POST	POST request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it

PUT	The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified and if the URI 
does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.

DELETE	The DELETE method deletes the specified resource

HEAD	The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.

PATCH	It is used for modify capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource
